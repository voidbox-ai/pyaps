# py-aps

Python SDK for Autodesk Platform Service APIs

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-aps
```

## Overview

py-aps is a Python SDK that provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with Autodesk Platform Services (formerly known as Forge) APIs. This SDK simplifies authentication, data management, and automation workflows for APS-powered applications.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Easy OAuth2 authentication flow
- **Data Management**: Access and manage files in BIM 360, ACC, and other Autodesk cloud storage
- **Automation**: Automate design and engineering workflows

## Quick Start

### Authentication
```python
from pyaps.auth import AuthClient, Scopes

# 2-legged OAuth
client = AuthClient(client_id="...", client_secret="...")
token = client.two_legged.get_token([Scopes.DATA_READ])
```

### Data Management
```python
from pyaps.datamanagement import DataManagementClient

dm = DataManagementClient(token_provider=lambda: token.access_token)

# List hubs and projects
hubs = list(dm.hubs.list())
projects = list(dm.hubs.list_projects(hub_id))

# Browse folders
contents = list(dm.folders.contents(project_id, folder_id))
```

### Design Automation
```python
from pyaps.automation import AutomationClient

auto = AutomationClient(token_provider=lambda: token.access_token)

# List engines
engines = auto.list_engines()

# Create and execute workitem
workitem = auto.start_workitem({
    'activityId': 'Owner.MyActivity+prod',
    'arguments': {...}
})
```
